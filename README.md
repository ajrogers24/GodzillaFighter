# GodzillaFighter

Thank you for checking out my Godzilla fighter game!

Overview: This project is an RPG-style game developed to act as a fighter game similar to the style of PokÃ©mon. In this game, you will be faced and challenged with making decisions of attacks and defense based on your opponent. Each player will start the game at 100 health and you will take turns with the AI to try and get their health to 0 before yours gets there! You will have the choice of several different attacks and ways to regenerate your health. But, be careful because some of your attacks can be more risky than others in terms of how much damage you actually do to your opponent.

Major parts: Ability to enter your fighter's name. Different styles of attacks and defense for you to fight the style that you choose. I also imported the time and random module into my code.

Instructions/How to Play: Simply download the GodzillaFighter.py file to your computer you will also need to be able to run Python, so make sure that is installed( you can install that here https://www.python.org ) -> Then launch any IDE of your choice. Not sure what an IDE is? It is an integrated development environment used for programming. Here is a link to my favorite if you need to download one! https://code.visualstudio.com Once you have your IDE, simply launch it -> go to File -> Open File, and select the GodzillaFighter.py file you downloaded earlier. From here when the code launches, you can click run and the game will simply run through your terminal! Thanks again for checking out my game, I hope you enjoy it.
